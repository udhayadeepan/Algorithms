# Searching and Sorting Algorithms using Java

Sorting:
# Bubble Sort
  The bubble sort algorithm is a reliable sorting algorithm. This algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n2). The bubble sort has a space complexity of O(1). The number of swaps in bubble sort equals the number of inversion pairs in the given array.
# Insertion Sort
  The worst-case (and average-case) complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is O(nÂ²). Meaning that, in the worst case, the time taken to sort a list is proportional to the square of the number of elements in the list. The best-case time complexity of insertion sort algorithm is O(n) time complexity
# Selection Sort
   the time complexity of Selection Sort is O(N2). The worst case is the case when the array is already sorted 

Searching:
# Binary Search
 Used to search a element when array is sorted.
# Linear Search
  Used to search when the array is unsorted.
